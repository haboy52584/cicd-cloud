The expected output and results after following the steps to provision, configure, and test the infrastructure are as follows:

1. Terraform output:

   After executing `terraform apply`, Terraform will provision the resources and display the front-end URL as an output. It will look similar to this:

   ```
   Apply complete! Resources: 6 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

   Outputs:

   frontend_url = "ec2-xx-xx-xx-xx.your-region.compute.amazonaws.com"
   ```


2. Ansible output:

   When running the Ansible playbook, you'll see a summary of the tasks executed on each instance. The output will look like this:

   ```
   PLAY [frontend] ***************************************************************

   TASK [Gathering Facts] *********************************************************
   ok: [frontend-instance]

   ...

   PLAY [backend] *****************************************************************

   TASK [Gathering Facts] *********************************************************
   ok: [backend-instance]

   ...

   PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
   backend-instance           : ok=6    changed=4    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0   
   frontend-instance          : ok=8    changed=6    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0   
   ```

   This output indicates that all tasks have been executed successfully (no failed tasks).

3. Chef output:

   After applying the Chef cookbook on the back-end instance, you should see output similar to this:

   ```
   Starting Chef Infra Client, version 17.9.0
   resolving cookbooks for run list: ["database"]
   Synchronizing Cookbooks:
     - database (0.1.0)
   Installing Cookbook Gems:
   Compiling Cookbooks...
   Converging 2 resources
   Recipe: database::default
     * apt_package[postgresql] action install (up to date)
     * service[postgresql] action enable (up to date)
     * service[postgresql] action start (up to date)

   Running handlers:
   Running handlers complete
   Chef Infra Client finished, 0/3 resources updated in 01 seconds
   ```

   This output shows that the database-related tasks have been executed successfully.

4. Application testing:

   When you access the front-end URL provided by Terraform in your web browser, you should see the sample application's user interface.
